==== Script Developer Guide ====

Abstract:

Lazyscripts is a software which can be used to install software and configure
settings in a Linux system. Most of the open source software developers are
engineers, and most of the programs are written for engineers, so sometimes
it is difficult to satisfy the end-users.

Lazyscripts has one purpose -- to reduce the gap between end-users and
developers. It provides simple ways for developers can use simple ways to write
scripts, and their configuration files in the right place; the rest 
can be done by Lazyscripts. After having installed Lazyscripts, end-users are
able to easily install software and configure some features in Linux by simpily
selecting check boxes in the graphical user interface.

Welcome to join the Lazyscripts Developer Team. Your work can save time to
prepare new installations of Linux, and also make the work of Linux advocates
easier.

=== Structure ===

Lazyscripts works with script pools, in a similar way like package managers
work with repositories. The script pools contains the scripts that will be
available for the end-users, including their metadata.

Here is the structure of a script pool:

         Local                                  Github
                              (2)
        Lazyscripts Core Program --------------> Script pool
              | (1)                      ex: git://github.com/aminzai/
              V                        /     lzs_pool_debianlize.git
       ~/.lazyscripts/                /
              |- config          (3) /
              |- pools/             /
                  |-debianlize  <---

                  |(4)
                  V
              Show menu and GUI
                  |(5)
                  V
                /tmp/lzs_root/
                       |-lzs_storagedenv 
                       |-taskscripts  <-- (6)
                       |-shlib/

When Lazyscripts runs for the first time, here is its workflow:
1. Lazyscripts will build a "~/.lazyscripts" directory, which contains a
   configuration file. All the script pools information will be held in
   this the configuration file.
2. Lazyscripts will then find the script pools which matches the Linux
   distribution on which it is running. If there is more than one such script
   pool, Lazyscripts will pop up a dialog with a list and let the user choose
   one.
3. Lazyscripts will check out the files from the selected scripts pool through
   git, and put them into "~/lazyscripts/pools". Every script pool has its own
   subdirectory.
4. Lazyscripts will analyze the "desc.ini" from the pool to find the information 
   about the script pool, then show the GUI, menus and options.
5. After the user has choosen one or several scripts to run by ticking the
   matching checkboxes, then clicked on the "Apply" button, Lazyscripts will
   download and import the repository keys required by the package manager.
   Then Lazyscripts will build a "lzs_root" directory in "/tmp", which includes all
   files necessary for running the scripts. In "lzs_storagedenv", each
   environment variable for scripts will be defined. A "shlib" directory comes from
   the shlib directory from the scripts pool. It is a toolkit that provides shell
   functions that can be used by the scripts at run-time.
   The package names defined in "remove.txt" will be removed first from the
   system, and the packages defined in "install.txt" will be installed. For
   this, Lazyscripts will make use of the distribution specific package
   manager. Finally, Lazyscripts will execute the script itself and let it
   make changes to the system, to configure it.
6. The entry point for the script execution is "taskscripts". The command
   defined in it is generated automatically by Lazyscripts.
   After the execution has finished or has been cancelled, the "lzs_root" directory
   is deleted automatically. This avoids permission issues when different users are
   running Lazyscripts.


==== Script pool structure ====

  The script pool structure is really simple. Just follow the
  instructions and the format to write the metadata files or scripts, and
  place them in the right location. Lazyscripts will analyze these files and
  use them. The following will introduce the structure of scripts pool, and
  explain the contents of the files.

  Here is the structure of git://github.com/aminzai/lzs_pool_debianlize.git


 lzs_pool_debianlize/
        |-README                          - README file, contains the general description and possibly the license of the pool
        |-desc.ini                        - description file, contains the name and description of the script pool, specify the
        |                                 the icons, and translation of category names.
        |-recommand.ini                   - Recommandation list. The items defined in this file will pre-checked at the time Lazyscripts is launched.
        |-shlib/                          - The directory to place toolkits. All the directory will be copy to /tmp/lzs_root before scripts execute. The scripts or tools inside can be used in any script.
        |    |-shlib.bash                 - The toolkits. In this example, shlib.bash support environment variation for bash shell script,
        |    |-debinstall.py                debinstall.py can analyze the depandency of deb files, and install the packages by apt-get.
        |
        |-sources.d/                      - All the repository for install programes.
        |    |-keylist.txt                - Defines the keys for the repository (needed by Ubuntu). The keys can be downloaded
        |    |                            from a keyserver, or imported.
        |    |-lzs_i686_ubuntu_10.04.list - This is the repository sources for Ubuntu 10.04 and i386.
        |    |- .....
        |
        |-Multimedia/                     - Scripts of Multimedia will place under this directory.
        |    |-non-free-codecs/           - This is a script directory, all the files inside it are part of the script.
        |    |      |                     In this example, the script installs the non-free multimedia codecs support.
        |    |      |- desc.ini           - Description file. It contains the name, description, and warning messages of the script. 
        |    |      |                     This file also defines the supported distributions, platforms, and other attributes.
        |    |      |- options.ini        - The options supported by this script.
        |    |      |- script             - Lazyscripts will execute this script for the configuration post-install.
        |    |      |- ubuntu_def/        - The settings directory for a specific distribution. This case is for Ubuntu.
        |    |      |      |-source.txt   - Source information of non-official repository.
        |    |      |      |-remove.txt   - The packages which will be removed.
        |    |      |      |-install.txt  - The packages which will be installed.
        |    |      |
        |    |      |- debian_def/        - Settings directory for Debian
        |    |             |- ....
        |    |
        |    |-free-codecs/               - Script directory for free-codecs.
        |           |- ....
        |- ....

==== Workflow ====

When executing a script, Lazyscripts will use the following workflow:
1. Remove the packages defined in "remove.txt"
2. Install the packages defined in "install.txt".
3. Execution of the script to do the post-install configuration

The script defined interact will be execute together.
